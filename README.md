# MicroBrick allows to easily reconfigure your MikroTik without tinkering with winbox or browser. It clears the default MT IP from .ssh known_hosts and through a set of three .bat files filled with SSH commands securely creates new configuration for MT. This is the first version, many additional features will be added in the future.
Currently it creates a network, with a total of 254 adresses available in the desired scope and additionaly allows to create a wireless network with a ssid and a password of your choosing. Default password created on the MicroBrick is the routers serial number.
